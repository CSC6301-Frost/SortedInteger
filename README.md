# CSC-6301 Sorted Integer List Program

This Java application takes in user inputted integers from the console, stores them in sorted ascending order, and then prints out the full list once the user input has completed.

---

## About

The **SortedIntegerLinkedList** program asks the user for integers until a non-integer is entered.
Once a non-integer is entered, then the completed sorted integer list is displayed.  
The list itself is stored in memory in a linked list using the Java utility LinkedList<Integer>.
As the user input is entered, the data is sorted to ensure that the linked list of integers is always in ascending order.
